A restful API for social media using spring REST.

## Design and implementation of a full restful API: level 3 of Richardson maturity model.
I have used HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)  to deal with discovering the possibilities of the API
towards the clients.

## This project was made for training purpose only in order to understand the design of a full restful API and to initiate to spring REST.

It offers many services as:  
- Get, add, update and delete a message.
- Get, add, update and delete a comment of the specified message.
- Get, add, update and delete a link of the specified message.
- Get, add, update and delete a profile.
